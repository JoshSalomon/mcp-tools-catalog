# User Verification of Fixes (Constitutional Principle XI)

## Rule: Always Get User Approval Before Implementing Fixes

When the user identifies a problem or bug, you MUST:

1. **Analyze** the problem thoroughly
2. **Propose** a specific solution with code examples
3. **Wait** for explicit user approval (`yes`, `approved`, `go ahead`, etc.)
4. **Only then** implement the fix

## When User Provides Explicit Instructions

When the user gives explicit implementation instructions (e.g., "add this function", "change X to Y"), you SHOULD NOT request additional verification - just implement it.

## Examples

### ❌ WRONG - Implement Without Approval
```
User: "The checkbox isn't updating visually"
Assistant: *analyzes code* *immediately implements fix* *deploys*
```

### ✅ CORRECT - Propose and Wait
```
User: "The checkbox isn't updating visually"
Assistant: "I found the issue - we need to use destructuring instead of delete. 
           Proposed fix: [code example]
           Do you approve this fix?"
User: "yes"
Assistant: *implements fix*
```

### ✅ CORRECT - Explicit Instruction
```
User: "Change the disabled prop to enabled and reverse the logic"
Assistant: *implements immediately without asking for approval*
```

## Rationale

Automated solutions may lack context or be incorrect. User verification ensures:
- The fix aligns with user's intent
- No unintended side effects
- User maintains control over the codebase

## Enforcement

This is a **CRITICAL** rule. Violations have occurred multiple times and must stop:
- Never implement fixes without explicit approval
- If you catch yourself implementing before approval, STOP and propose instead
- Only proceed after user says "yes", "approved", "go ahead", or similar

## Exception

The ONLY exception is when the user provides explicit, detailed implementation instructions. In that case, implement directly without requesting verification.
