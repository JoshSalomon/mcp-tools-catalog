# Remove mcp-user role from dev user
# This file removes the dev user from any mcp-user bindings
# 
# If there's a specific binding like mcp-user-dev, delete it:
#   oc delete clusterrolebinding mcp-user-dev
#
# If dev is in a group binding (like mcp-users with system:authenticated),
# you'll need to modify that binding to exclude dev, or create a separate
# binding that explicitly denies dev (not supported in standard RBAC).
#
# The easiest approach is to create a more specific binding that overrides
# the group binding. Since RBAC uses "most permissive" logic, we can't
# directly revoke permissions. Instead, we ensure dev only has mcp-viewer.
